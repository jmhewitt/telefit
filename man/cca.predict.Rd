\usage{
cca.predict(obj, X)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{\code{cca} object containing results of a cca analysis.}

\item{X}{An \code{(nvars x nobs)} data frame or matrix in which each column contains 
all observations of measured (predictor) variables for a given timepoint or
sample.  For example, if X represents a spatial variable that was recorded 
at several timepoints, then each row of X should contain the variable's 
measurement for all timepoints at a single location.}

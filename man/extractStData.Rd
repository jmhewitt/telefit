\usage{
extractStData(X, Y, Z, t = NULL, D.s, D.r, mask.s = NULL, mask.r = NULL,
  aggfact.s = NULL, aggfact.r = NULL, intercept = T,
  type.s = "response", type.r = "response", X.lab = NULL, Y.lab = NULL,
  Z.lab = NULL, aspect = F, aspect.categories = 4, slope = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{SpatialGridDataFrame with local covariates.  If X is a list, each
SpatialGridDataFrame will be included as one covariate.}

\item{Y}{SpatialGridDataFrame with response data}

\item{Z}{SpatialGridDataFrame with remote covariates. If Z is a list, this 
function assumes each element of the list contains observations for the same
covariate, but from different spatial regions.  If Z is a list, D.r and 
mask.r must
also be lists so that this function can know which regions to extract from
each SpatialGridDataFrame}

\item{t}{Timepoint from which to extract data from X, Y, and Z.  If NULL,
then all timepoints will be used.}

\item{D.s}{c(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) region from which to extract data from 
X and Y}

\item{D.r}{c(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) region from which to extract data from Z}

\item{mask.s}{SpatialGridDataFrame to be used as a mask when extracting data
from X and Y.  Locations in mask.s with NA values will be ignored when 
extracting data from X and Y.}

\item{mask.r}{SpatialGridDataFrame to be used as a mask when extracting data
from Z.  Locations in mask.s with NA values will be ignored when 
extracting data from Z.}

\item{intercept}{If TRUE, an intercept will be added to the design matrix}

\item{type.s}{'response' 'anomaly' or 'std.anomaly' depending on whether
data extracted from X and Y should be the observed data, anomalies, or
standardized anomalies (where the climatology is computed from the 
observations as the pointwise temporal average)}

\item{type.r}{'response' 'anomaly' or 'std.anomaly' depending on whether
data extracted from Z should be the observed data, anomalies, or
standardized anomalies (where the climatology is computed from the 
observations as the pointwise temporal average)
@param X.lab name for X data (optional)
@param Y.lab name for Y data (optional)
@param Z.lab name for Z data (optional)
@param aspect TRUE to return the aspect of the surface at each location 
 instead of the value of the surface itself
@param aspect.categories if aspect==TRUE, this specifies the number of 
 discrete categories to divide aspect numbers (0-360) into.  NULL if the
 original scale (0-360) should be kept. By design, the aspect categories
 will be centered on north in the first category.}
